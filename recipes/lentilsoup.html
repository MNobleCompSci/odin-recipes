<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
A well made Lentil Soup recipe is can't-stop-eating-it good. You'll go back for seconds and thirds, then you'll be taking big tubs of it to work for lunch and happily have it for dinner again.

If you're wondering if lentil soup is good for you, the answer is yes! Lentils are nutritious, rich in minerals, protein, low in fat, high in fibre (digestive health). They are a terrific vegetarian source of protein with 25% of the calories in lentils attributable to protein.

It tastes savoury and has a flavour boost from a hint of spices. There's an undertone of natural sweetness from the soffrito flavour base of onion, carrot and celery. My favourite part is the texture! It's thick and comforting, and just made for dunking in hot crusty bread!
